Copy number and alignment of key genes in hrmA cluster in A.fumigatus across strains

For Kowalski et al. 2019. This work supports the data presented in
manuscript to estimate copy number of hrmA and cgnA and cgnA-like
genes in the genomes of assembled Aspergillus fumigatus strain
genomes. The strain assemblies are stored as .fasta.gz files in idx
folder which were constructed from public data in SRA database. See
SRA_samples.csv for information about the individual strains used.

The cluster_seq_alignments folder contains multiple alignments of the
sequences extracted from the multiple strains.

The cross-species folder contains protein searches across the fungi.

the folder pipeline contains scripts for running analysis of individual copies against genome assemblies of strains and summarizing the results.

strain_tree is a focused tree of strains used and considered for Kowalski et al 2019 work.
