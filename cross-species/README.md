This folder contains cross-species protein searches and results for
the HAC genes across all fungi. The database of all fungi was
constructed from JGI Mycocosm https://jgi.doe.gov/fungi and FungiDB
https://fungidb.org/fungidb/ and Ensembl Fungi
https://fungi.ensembl.org/index.html datasets as part of development
of 1000 fungal genomes project https://github.com/1KFG/2019_dataset

The query.sh script shows the analysis run and the .tab and SSEARCH
files show results from SSEARCH while .domtbl and .phmmer show phmmer
results.
